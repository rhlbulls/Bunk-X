# bunkx2

Bunkx is a Flutter application that displays detailed attendance statistics for PSG College of Technology.

An app to view your attendance in charts, coded in flutter and python. Used Beautiful Soup and Request library to make a scraping API in Python using flask and hosted the API on Beanstalk  AWS. The Flutter app is made such that it can pull data from the API through HTTP request and show them in charts using FLUTTER_CHART library. And wrote a simple algorithm that can find the number of days a person can bunk in the future without having to worry about lack of attendance.
